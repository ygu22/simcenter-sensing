## Scope

Wearable-sensor capture of autonomic-nervous-system signals during simulation
sessions: heart rate and HRV, electrodermal activity, skin temperature,
accelerometry, and (depending on device) respiration and ECG.

## Devices in active use

| Device         | Signals                                | Wear location | Subdir |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------|--------|
| Empatica E4    | BVP, EDA, skin temp, 3-axis accel       | Wrist         | [devices/empatica-e4/](devices/empatica-e4/README.md) |
| EmotiBit       | PPG, EDA, skin temp, 3-axis IMU, more   | Wrist / chest | [devices/emotibit/](devices/emotibit/README.md) |
| BioRadio       | GSR, ECG, RIP (respiration), pulse ox   | Chest + pod   | [devices/bioradio/](devices/bioradio/README.md) |

## Cross-device material

Sections below cover material common to running a physio session with any
combination of devices. Device-specific details live under `devices/`.

## TODOs for collaborators

<!-- TODO(unassigned): Triage existing physio notes and code; this is a high-priority Phase 1 effort -->

- [ ] Identify canonical sync code (see [tpd's `1_funcs_generic.R`](../../docs/storage.md)) and migrate / link from `shared/`
- [ ] Draft per-device fitting protocols
- [ ] Document multi-device time-sync routine (clocks across E4 + EmotiBit + BioRadio)
- [ ] Capture known-failure catalog from Joplin notes and prior studies
- [ ] Define derived feature schema (HR, HRV bands, EDA tonic/phasic, etc.)
