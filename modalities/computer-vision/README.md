## Scope

Camera-based extraction of pose (3D body keypoints), head frame, and
heuristic gaze direction during simulation sessions, from a multi-camera ZED
setup driven by the Stereolabs SDK + Fusion module on a ZedBox.

## Current platform

**ZedBox** + multiple ZED cameras, recording to SVO2 and processed offline via
`code/replay_fusion_enhanced.py`. The earlier Intel RealSense workflow is
preserved under [`_archive/intel-cameras/`](_archive/intel-cameras/README.md)
for reference only (status: archived).

## TODOs for collaborators

- [ ] Fill the ZedBox hardware table in [hardware.md](hardware.md) (model, SDK version, camera count)
- [ ] Quantify per-hour disk use for the chosen recording profile ([pre-session.md](pre-session.md))
- [ ] Populate [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md) from pilot-session notes
- [ ] Verify BODY_34 / BODY_38 keypoint indices in `code/gaze_geometry.py` against deployed SDK
- [ ] Decide and document a gaze model to plug into `GazeEstimator.predict()`
- [ ] Lift `USER CONFIG` block in `replay_fusion_enhanced.py` to a YAML or CLI args
- [ ] Add a room/coverage diagram under `assets/`
- [ ] Write a small renamer helper to convert `~/zed_rec/<serial>.svo2` to the canonical session filename
